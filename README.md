# One Set To Failure

This is an Android weight training tracking app. It is made for SINGLE SET workouts only. It is ideal when you are training with one-set-to-failure workouts. These are workouts where you are not performing a weight exercise in multiple sets but you do one set with as many reps as you can until you can't do more. You can read about training to failure [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_to_failure). Be advised that this is a controversial topic.
