- exercise list: put days like "title" on Mon, Tue and Wed
- rule: always suggest previoues reps/weihght
- workoutlist: swipe gesture
- about
- where to update them?
        public int PreviousReps { get; set; }
        public double PreviousWeight { get; set; }

- object to validate the common seettings between settings and exercises
  e.g RepsForWeightDn cant be greater than RepsForWeightUp

- exercise page: delete 
 - exercise settings that need to be overriden
        // Exercises page
        // have options to override all training rules (rest timer included)
        // where to have it? see UI patterns 
        //   app toolbar button: Training Rules?
        //   button Training Rules?
        //   tabs: Basic / Advanced?

- day notes, workout notes?
                   
- do I need user id in all tables? 
    <--- or create another table with setings for a day -->
          Exersiceid, sort numb and date and give the option to move exercises on a day.

    <--- sort numb is not going to workig because an exercice is part of multiple days 
    <--- maybe we need the routine after all

- idea: ability to print a routine or weekly program. call it old school printout or export in a txt file.

- score system
  + for every new rep
  - for every down
