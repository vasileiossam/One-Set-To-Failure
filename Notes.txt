- do I need user id in all tables?
  <--- or create another table with setings for a day -->
        Exersiceid, sort numb and date and give the option to move exercises on a day.
  <--- sort numb is not going to workig because an exercice is part of multiple days
  <--- maybe we need the routine after all
