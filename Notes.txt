- workoutpage list
  - replace the labels chevrons with images because their not responsive? 
  - or use the blue button?

  - find active routines for the day
	-if one then display extersises in routine and dont display routine header
	- if more than one display first a header for routnine and then display extersies

		- find workouts for the day
			- merge them with routine
			- what is left
			- what i want
			- display the program (what I have to do)
			- display what I DID
 			- allow workout without routine

- exercise list:
  - put days like "title" on Mon, Tue and Wed

- exercise page 
  - put save and delete buttons on toolbar?
  - settings that need to be overriden
        // Exercises page
        // have options to override all training rules (rest timer included)
        // where to have it? see UI patterns 
        //   app toolbar button: Training Rules?
        //   button Training Rules?
        //   tabs: Basic / Advanced?

- score system
 + for every new rep
 - for every down
 
- do I need user id in all tables? 

       
                    <--- or create another table with setings for a day -->
                          Exersiceid, sort numb and date and give the option to move exercises on a day.

                    <--- sort numb is not going to workig because an exercice is part of multiple days 
                    <--- maybe we need the routine after all

- idea: ability to print a routine or weekly program. call it old school printout or export in a txt file.
