 - empty days look in evernote/ui/empty datasets

        public int PreviousReps { get; set; }
        public double PreviousWeight { get; set; }

   <StackLayout Orientation="Vertical" >
      <Label Text="{i18n:Translate Reps}" />
      <StackLayout Orientation="Horizontal">
        <Button Text="&#9660;" Clicked="OnWeightDownButtonClicked" x:Name="WeightDownButton1" />
        <Entry Text="{Binding Workout.Weight, Converter={StaticResource integerConverter}}" x:Name="repsEntry" /> 
        <Button Text="&#9650;"  x:Name="WeightUpButton1" />
      </StackLayout>
    </StackLayout>

<!--

- object to validate the common seettings between settings and exercises
  e.g RepsForWeightDn cant be greater than RepsForWeightUp

    should be a drop down.. do we also have spin controls


    *****************************************************
    Goal +1 next weight level!              <- show the +1 goal and if we doing moving to next weight level
       [UP] 10 /100                         <- tap here will fill
                                            <- only show when new                
    *****************************************************
    Workout   
      Reps
        < [11] > +1                         <- +1 in relation with previous 
    
      Weights
        < [100] >                                 <--- convert weights when saving?
   *****************************************************
            Done it!                      | when new, if saved change label to Save
            Cancel                      

- Merge goal and Workout?
and use + and arrows to denote the increase?

-  Suggseions?

              Setting:
    Done it! goes to next workout or only back
      if goes to next then rest screen

- workoutpage list
  - find active routines for the day
	-if one then display extersises in routine and dont display routine header
	- if more than one display first a header for routnine and then display extersies

		- find workouts for the day
			- merge them with routine
			- what is left
			- what i want
			- display the program (what I have to do)
			- display what I DID
 			- allow workout without routine

 - day notes, workout notes?

- exercise list:
  - put days like "title" on Mon, Tue and Wed

- exercise page 
  - put save and delete buttons on toolbar?
  - settings that need to be overriden
        // Exercises page
        // have options to override all training rules (rest timer included)
        // where to have it? see UI patterns 
        //   app toolbar button: Training Rules?
        //   button Training Rules?
        //   tabs: Basic / Advanced?

- score system
 + for every new rep
 - for every down
 
- do I need user id in all tables? 

       
                    <--- or create another table with setings for a day -->
                          Exersiceid, sort numb and date and give the option to move exercises on a day.

                    <--- sort numb is not going to workig because an exercice is part of multiple days 
                    <--- maybe we need the routine after all

- idea: ability to print a routine or weekly program. call it old school printout or export in a txt file.



- research: 1) development in iphone watch 2) ideas?
- idea: fitness log platform
  - search: https://www.google.com.au/search?q=fitness+log&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=Vmj2VLr0A6TDmwXPzoC4AQ
  - user can havily customize it
  - can log any sport or fitness activity: walking, swiming, weights ec
  - has its own API
  - uses other APIs like fitbit
  - its mobile, web and watch
  - can convert activity to steps
